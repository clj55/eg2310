Most of the files here are to setup the turtlebot3 Burger. The main program will be inside the file "autonomous_exploration". Inside, there will be three python files:
1) Rpi->esp32_test.py
2) __init__.py
3) control.py

The main algorithm will be inside control.py. Since this program has been extracted from another turkish github repo, the files are deemed to be hard to debug. Therefore, Claire has
decided to make the whole algo by herself (YAY GOATED ðŸ¥³ ðŸ’… ). Will update here when she finishes the code.
